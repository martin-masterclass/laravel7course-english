                    If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. That's crazy.

                    Don't fiddle with it all day. Learn when to stop. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.

                    This is the fun part Every day I learn. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.

                    Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. It all happens automatically. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted.

                    The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. There we go. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And maybe a little bush lives there. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.

                    Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. You can spend all day playing with mountains. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. The light is your friend. Preserve it.
